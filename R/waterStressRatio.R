#' @title waterStressRatio
#'
#' @description calculates water stress ratio from water availability and water demand in MAgPIE.
#'              Water stress ratio is the ratio of water withdrawals (in the growing period)
#'              to water availability (in the growing period)
#'
#' @param gdx         GDX file
#' @param file        a file name the output should be written to using write.magpie
#' @param level       spatial level of aggregation: "cell" (cellular), "reg" (regional),
#'                    "glo" (global), "regglo" (regional and global) or
#'                    "grid" (grid cell)
