\arguments{
\item{gdx}{GDX file}

\item{level}{Level of regional aggregation; "reg" (regional), "glo" (global), "regglo" (regional and global) or any other aggregation level defined in superAggregate}

\item{products}{Selection of products (either by naming products, e.g. "tece", or naming a set,e.g."kcr")}

\item{product_aggr}{aggregate over products or not. Usually boolean, but here also the value "kres" is allowed, which provides kcr aggregated to kres}

\item{attributes}{dry matter: Mt ("dm"), gross energy: PJ ("ge"), reactive nitrogen: Mt ("nr"), phosphor: Mt ("p"), potash: Mt ("k"), wet matter: Mt ("wm"). Can also be a vector.}

\item{water_aggr}{aggregate irrigated and non-irriagted production or not (boolean).}
